# Basic Neural Network Architecture


This project is simply a demonstration of a basic neural network architecture.
In the root directory you can find the single file "Network.java" which contains
all the necessary tools of creating a network.
This network was created by Jonathan Lee under the guidance of Dr. Eric Nelson of the Harker School.

What are neural networks and what purpose do they serve? The short answer: They are awesome and they make the world a better place.
The long answer: (Artificial neural network)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network]
You can also read one of my papers on neural networks or perceptrons to get an idea of what they are, how they are created and some of their applications.
